                        I recently discovered the game of cricket after moving to New Zealand (Go Blackcaps!), and set about exploring the game through a process of creating my own visualizations of the results of cricket matches. Consider these designs meditations on my new favorite sport.

                        Note: This is a work in progress, built for my own entertainment and education. I am only posting it online because a couple of fellow cricket enthusiasts I've shown it to have asked me to share it. It's buggy in spots, sometimes gets totals wrong, and has only ever been viewed up to this point by me in Google Chrome on a MacBook retina display. It may look quite crap on anything else. You've been warned.
                        
                        The main chart I've been working on is a modified "Manhattan" graph, in that it's essentially a series of bars whose heights show the number of runs in each over. However, I've broken down each bar to show a distinct mark for each ball bowled. Dot balls (deliveries for no runs) display as, well, a dot. A single run is a circle the height of two dots. Balls for more than one run display as an oblong shape proportionally as high as the number of runs (3 runs are the height of 3 balls, 4 run 4 balls high, etc), accounting for a small amount of padding between each mark. The tiny padding makes a huge visual difference, allowing each mark to read as distinct, even at the end of a long game.
                        
                        Cricket is all about the steady accumulation of runs, and I've tried to stay true to that by showing an individual mark for every ball in play, but still letting the overall shape of the game be read at a glance.
